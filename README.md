Movie Recommendation System


The movie recommendation system has been implemented using Flask and feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer. 

The default username and password for the demo is: 'admin' and 'password'. The users are stored in a database 'user' and a table inside the database 'user'.

Please set up the database for the login part to work correctly. To try the recommendation system navigate directly to 'localhost:5000/movies'
Dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle] ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata" )
